//! A library for reading and writing TAR archives
//!
//! This library provides utilities necessary to manage [TAR archives][1]
//! abstracted over a reader or writer. Great strides are taken to ensure that
//! an archive is never required to be fully resident in memory, and all objects
//! provide largely a streaming interface to read bytes from.
//!
//! [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29

// More docs about the detailed tar format can also be found here:
// http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+8-current

// NB: some of the coding patterns and idioms here may seem a little strange.
//     This is currently attempting to expose a super generic interface while
//     also not forcing clients to codegen the entire crate each time they use
//     it. To that end lots of work is done to ensure that concrete
//     implementations are all found in this crate and the generic functions are
//     all just super thin wrappers (e.g. easy to codegen).

// FIXME(rust-lang/rust#26403):
//      Right now there's a bug when a DST struct's last field has more
//      alignment than the rest of a structure, causing invalid pointers to be
//      created when it's casted around at runtime. To work around this we force
//      our DST struct to instead have a forcibly higher alignment via a
//      synthesized u64 (hopefully the largest alignment we'll run into in
//      practice), and this should hopefully ensure that the pointers all work
//      out.
struct AlignHigher<R: ?Sized>(u64, R);
